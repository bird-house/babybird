Baby Bird
    *A minimal Bird (WPS) to get started with Web Processing Services.*


Baby Bird has an example of a WPS with minimal dependencies (PyWPS, buildout, an example process, ...). It provides also a skeleton function to create a new *Bird* from scratch with some configurations (title, version, port, ...).
